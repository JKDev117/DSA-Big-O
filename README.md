Create a GitHub repo called DSA-Big-O. Save all this work in the repo and submit the repo via the submission box at the end of this checkpoint.

In these drills, you'll practice determining the big O complexity of algorithms. 
For each drill, we'll provide a code snippet with a function, and you'll work out the big O complexity by analyzing the code without running it.
